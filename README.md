# World Domination - Discord Web Game

World Domination - Discord Web Game is an immersive online experience where players engage in a strategic competition between nations. The game takes place within Discord using a dedicated web application, allowing players to interact, negotiate, and witness the consequences of their actions from previous rounds. The core concept of the game revolves around communication and establishing connections with other countries, but with a twist: even the most loyal ally can turn out to be a traitor, launching a nuclear missile against you when you least expect it.

In this highly dynamic and unpredictable game, players must carefully navigate diplomatic relationships, forge alliances, gather intelligence, and engage in espionage to ensure the survival and prosperity of their nation. Trust is a valuable but fragile commodity, and every decision carries the weight of potential betrayal. Choose your allies wisely, but always be prepared for unexpected turns of events.
